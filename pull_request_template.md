https://the-turing-way.netlify.app/reproducible-research/reviewing.html
For the coder
[ ] Does the new code meet project standards? In particular,
[ ] Is there documentation?
[ ] Are there new tests for the new material?
[ ] Do these tests pass locally?
[ ] Are you following any declared style guides?
[ ] Are the tests in the rest of the code base still passing locally?
[ ] Create the pull request; wait for any CI checks to complete.
[ ] Consult the CI reports. Did all the builds and tests complete?
[ ] If necessary, now formally request a review.
[ ] Once review is complete, discuss any comments necessary.
[ ] Make the changes, and record the changes made against appropriate comments.
[ ] Check that the reviewer knows you believe you have fully addressed the review.
For the reviewer
[ ] Check the code meets basic project style, if this is not automatically checked by CI.
[ ] Check there are tests & documentation to necessary standards.
[ ] Read the code, carefully.
[ ] Is all the code easily understood?
[ ] Is it clear what all sections of the code do?
[ ] Are the logic and approach in the proposed changes clear?
[ ] Are the logic and the approach both sound?
[ ] Do the tests actually ensure the code is robust in its intended use?
[ ] Are there any bugs or other defects?
[ ] As needed, engage constructively with the coder if they disagree on certain points in order to come to a consensus.
[ ] Once the coder believes changes are complete, check that they do indeed address all of the initial comments.
[ ] Approve the changes, and if it is your responsibility, make the merge.
